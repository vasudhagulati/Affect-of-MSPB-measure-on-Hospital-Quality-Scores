Determining the association between Medicare Spending per beneficiary (MSPB) measure and Hospital Quality Scores
The analysis is based on the United States 2021 hospital-level data from the CMS Hospital Compare data set. Rural-Urban Continuum codes for the year 2021 are taken from USDA and the Cost of index is calculated based on the Wisevoter website. This study's sample, according to Hospital Compare data, is approximately 4649 hospitals.
A statistical analysis of the association between different factors/variables and the hospital star ratings is provided. The primary outcome measure for this study is healthcare spending as quantified by the MSPB Measure.
The data is imported from these sources into Excel. After cleansing the Excel files separately, it was compiled together in MS Access. Through MS Access, the data is combined together and exported as an Excel file. That combined Excel file is used for statistical analysis in SAS Studio. The variable EmergencyServices is encoded into binary numbers to later use for statistical calculations. PowerBI is used to better understand the data by creating visualizations and gaining some insights from them. SPSS software is used to run the correlation matrix to determine the correlations among the variables.
